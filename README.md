# Cryptocurrencies

Use unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to analyze data on the cryptocurrencies traded on the market.

## Project Background

Present a report of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a classification for developing a new investment product. Use unsupervised ML clustering algorithm to help determine cryptocurrencies groups.

## Project Objectives

- Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.

- Reduce data dimensions using PCA (Principal Component Anylysis) algorithms from sklearn.

- Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.

- Create plots and data tables to present your results.

## Conclusion

Based on elbow curve figure, shown in the jupyter notebook data, I grouped the preprocessed 533 cryptocurrencies into 4 clusters in order to find their patterns. The 2d scatter figure shows clusters related to the number of available coins versus the total number of mined coins. The 3d scatter graph displays different clusters distributed with 3 principal component variables.
